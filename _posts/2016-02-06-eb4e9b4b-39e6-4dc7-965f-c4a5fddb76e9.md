## Vintage Computer Club History
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/16a4ebe9-f260-462f-ac72-a7a75f020baf.jpg)

The club was founded in 1998 with the aim to preserve the history of computers and share information with the general public. Currently the club is seeking premeses for meetings and for the display of it's private museum. our aim is to open a public museum in Malta.The museum would help future generations understand more how technology became part of our daily life and most important what type of technology we had. On our site one can find most of the information one needs. 

Computers in Malta awareness in these days left much to be desired, in fact only a couple of computer shops had opened, and the idea being these so called "Computers" were unreliable. Few companies used computers and at the time Computime offered a time sharing slot for companies to automate their system. The idea was great at the time as it was the very first cloud system. Computers entered our home thanks to electronics enthusiasts where they started building their own system. In 1983 Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and Amstrad started showing up on the local market. Prices started from LM275($660), but later that year Atari & Spectrum prices went down which started the battle of price drop. In 1985 the Commodore 128 entered the scene, but only a few where sold due to that IBM Computers where already started it's dominance, and business companies preferred more IBM computers than other ones. Another fact that this machine was never sold was that the Commodore128 was very expensive, and for only playing games and the decline of CP/M they preferred the Commodore 64, which was cheaper. In the meantime Amstrad with it's built in disk drive and easy to use basic was also dominating the scene in Malta. Amiga and Atari 520 ST showed up in the local market at the End of 1987 starting another era of 16bit technology.

Although Amiga was very powerful the public was not interested in this machine, but IBM users wanted the features that the Amiga had such as windows and multi-thread operations. When Amiga was introduced, IBM Compatible computers where very limited and not upgradeable to support GUI complex programs. So to solve this problem they started to produce more powerful computers, but with the same old structure, which could run both windows and previous Dos software resulting into crashes in the system. With the introduction of Microsoft windows on IBM computers, Commodore lost a lot of clients and went bankrupt. In the mean time Sinclair was sold to Amstrad and Apple started it's race with IBM and Microsoft. The spirit of the C64, Amiga, Spectrum and other 8bit computers as 8-16bit enthusiast are still active, building peripherals and producing games.
